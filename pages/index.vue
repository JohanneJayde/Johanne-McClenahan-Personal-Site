        Hello, My name is Johanne McClenahan. I want to help build web
        applications in the Spokane area to build up the community's economy.
        I’m currently looking for a job in the web application development
        field. I would prefer to have a job in front-end web development as I
        have experience in HTML and CSS. However, I do have experience working
        with MySQL and will learn PHP by April 2023, so I’m not opposed to
        working in back-end development.
