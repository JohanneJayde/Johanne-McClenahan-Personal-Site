          Hello, My name is Johanne McClenahan, and I recently moved to Spokane
          three years ago. I currently attend Eastern Washington University and
          expect to graduate in the Spring of 2024. My major is Computer Science
          with a minor in Web Application Development. My hobbies include
          puzzles, hiking, and scootering.
